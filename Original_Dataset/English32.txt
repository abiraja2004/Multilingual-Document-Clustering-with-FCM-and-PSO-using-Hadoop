BCCI to decide on Chandela issue 
this week Mumbai: The Cricket Board"s three-member disciplinary panel headed by president Shashank Manohar is to meet this week to decide on the fate of cricketers Ajit Chandela and Hiken Shah who have been alleged to have tried to fix IPL games in 2013 and this year respectively.
According to a BCCI source, the panel, which is to meet here on December 24, has the powers to impose punishment, including life bans, on the cricketers accused of trying to spot-fix IPL games.
Chandela was arrested by the police for trying to spot-fix IPL games in 2013 along with his then Rajasthan Royals teammates S Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan who both have been banned for life by the BCCI.
The BCCI is yet to decide on the quantum of punishment to be awarded to Chandela who has been suspended from the game since the scandal broke two years ago.
The BCCI will also decide on the punishment to be awarded to Mumbai Ranji Trophy cricketer Hiken Shah for his alleged breach of the Board"s anti-corruption code ahead of this year"s IPL.
