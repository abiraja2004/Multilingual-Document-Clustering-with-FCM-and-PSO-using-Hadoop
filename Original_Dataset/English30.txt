Maharashtra government on Tuesday decided to give special scholarships to students preparing for the all India services through UPSC examinations, with the objective of increasing the quantum of successful students from the state in these examinations.
The decision was taken at a meeting of the state cabinet, chaired by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis here.
The government will give a stipend of `10,000 per month, besides the scholarship, to those preparing for the prelim, main exam and interview, an official said. The government will spend ` 23.46 crore for this initiative, which includes cost of training at reputed institutes in Delhi.
The cabinet meeting, held at Mantralaya, also decided to reintroduce the ordinance for appointment of experts on Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) all over the state.
