by 32 paise/litre
Diesel by 85 paise/litre New Delhi, Jan. 15: Petrol price was today cut by 32 paise a litre and diesel by 85 paise even as the government hiked excise duty on both the fuels for the second time this month to raise an additional Rs 3,700 crore in its bid to achieve the targeted fiscal deficit.
