3) In-form Sania eyes 2nd consecutive IPTL title

New Delhi, Nov. 28: Having enjoyed a dream run in 2015, Indian tennis star Sania Mirza is hoping to continue her good performance in the second edition of the International Premier Tennis League (IPTL).
Sania has won 10 titles this season, including two Grand Slams - US Open and Wimbledon - alongside Swiss veteran Martina Hingis.
The Hyderabad girl is currently playing for the Indian Aces in the second edition of the IPTL. She was part of the Aces team that won the inaugural IPTL title last year.
"Winning 10 titles in a year is a dream season for me and hopefully I will be able to take this forward to next year as well," Sania told reporters here on Friday.
"Right now I am focused on the IPTL. Once it is over, I will start thinking about next year and my preparations for the Olympics."
"Once the IPTL is over, there will be a good six to seven months before the Olympics. There will be several tournaments before that as well," she added. The 29-year-old is excited about taking part in IPTL and is confident that the star-studded tournament will help the Indian players to improve themselves. "I am excited to take part in season two of the IPTL. The IPTL was a great success last year and I hope it will be bigger and better this year as well," Sania said.
"I have not played in Delhi since the Commonwealth Games. I am looking forward to playing here again."
