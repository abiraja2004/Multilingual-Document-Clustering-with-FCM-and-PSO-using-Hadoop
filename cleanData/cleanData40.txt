40)  Start-up and intolerance can't go together: RahulAs the Centre"s ambitious start-up mission got underway, Rahul Gandhi today trained his guns on the Narendra Modi government, saying there is a contradiction in pushing for start-ups and being "intolerant". The Congress vice president also said that the RSS has a very "rigid vision" for India and that start ups require free movement of ideas."The ruling dispensation, particularly the RSS, has a clear idea on what the world should look like. They have a vision for India which in my opinion is a very rigid vision. This country requires flexibility, openness and movement of ideas," Gandhi said, during an interaction with management students in suburban Vile Parle here. "There"s a huge contradiction in saying I want start ups but I will be intolerant," the Congress leader said.
