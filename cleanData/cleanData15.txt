Rohtagi said the HC had overlooked the fact that in the navy, neither men nor women, who are commissioned under short service category, can be given permanent commission. On September 4, the High Court had allowed a bunch of pleas seeking permanent commission for them in the force, saying "sexist bias and service bias" would not be allowed to block progress of women.
